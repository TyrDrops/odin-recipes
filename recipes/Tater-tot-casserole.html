            <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over Medium-high heat. Cook and stir your ground meat(I prefer turkey but feel free to use whatever you prefer) in the skillet, approximately 10 minutes. </li>
                <li>Stir in cream of mushroom soup and season to taste (at least with required salt and pepper, but get crazy with it add whatever you falvor you want such as taco seasoning or hamburger seasoning.)</li>
                <li>Transfer ground meat mixture in a 9x13-inch baking dish then layer frozen tater tots in a single layer. Be careful to not push the tots into the mixture less they become soggy.</li>
                <li>Bake according to frozen tot bag directions, approximately 30 minutes. Halfway through cooking time, remove to add cheese on top of tots.</li>
                <li>Garnish with fresh chopped chives. Serve and enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
