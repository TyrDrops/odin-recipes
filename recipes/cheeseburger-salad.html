                <li>Romaine Lettuce</li>
                <li>Ground meat</li>
                <li>Burger sauce</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
                <li>Pickles</li>
                <li>Onion</li>
                <li>Tomatoes</li>

            <h2>Recipe</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat a skillet and cook your preffered ground meat option (I like turkey for this but feel free to use a vegan option or beef).</li>
                <li>Chop your lettuce while your ground meat cooks. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to break meat apart even more. Season with seasonings, salt, and pepper and cook until meat is cooked through and no longer pink, about 5-7 minutes.</li>
                <li>While your meat is cooking, make your burger sauce. Combine ingredients for sauce in a small bowl or large liquid measuring cup. Mix together until smooth, tasting to see if you want to adjust any of the seasonings.</li>
                <li>Top the ground meat and lettuce with the tomatoes, pickles, onions, and cheese. Drizzle your cheeseburger bowls with your desired amount of burger sauce and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
